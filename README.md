# Custom List Implementation in Java

This project is a custom list implementation in Java, developed as part of an in-class activity. The goal of the exercise was to implement a custom list class with specific methods to manipulate the list. 

## Task Description

The following methods were required to be implemented:

1. **Search item in the list**: The method should search for an item in the list and raise an error if the item is not found.
2. **Remove item by value**: The method should remove an item from the list based on its value, raising an error if the value is not present.
3. **Check if the list is empty**: The method should return `true` if the list is empty, and `false` otherwise.
4. **Insert an element after the i-th item**: The method should insert a new item after the i-th position in the list. If the position does not exist, an error should be raised.
5. **Remove the i-th item from the list**: The method should remove the item at the i-th position in the list. If the position does not exist, an error should be raised.
6. **Return the size of the list**: The method should return the number of elements currently in the list.
7. **Allow modification of an element in the list**: The method should allow modifying an element at a given position in the list.
